### A few words about the project and its developer...

I can’t say I’m very professional but I can say the project was very instructive to me even though it may not be very beautiful to watch. 
I will do my best to open up anything anywhere in time. In part, the code can be very confusing when different components are thrown here and there. In particular, manual updating may require more clarification. I’m also trying to put something in the main Blazor settings.
